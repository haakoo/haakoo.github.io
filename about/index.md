I’m Håkon K. Olafsen a Norwegian that lives in Oslo with my Australian girlfriend and our dog Odin. I worked as a scientist at Kjeller and my main areas of (academic / work related) interest were software development and robotics / unmanned vehicles with focus on drones. Now I work as a Senior Software Engineer at Sopra Steria AS, writing C# code.

I've been told that I can also use the title _a bit flinging cyber ninja_. Not sure that's any better than _rockstar programmer_ or _10x programmer_...

These thoughts are mine and mine alone, and should not be accredited to my former or current employers.
