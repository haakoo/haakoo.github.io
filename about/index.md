I’m Håkon K. Olafsen a Norwegian that lives in Oslo with my Australian girlfriend and our dog Odin. I work as a Senior Advisor / project coordinator at an innovation centre at Kjeller, just outside of Oslo. Previously I've worked as a scientist and my main areas of (academic / work related) interest were software development and robotics / unmanned vehicles with focus on drones. I've had almost two years as a Senior Software Engineer at Sopra Steria AS, writing C# code.

These days some would claim my title is _pathfinder_. I've earlier been told that I could use the title _a bit flinging cyber ninja_. Not sure that's any better than _rockstar programmer_ or _10x programmer_... Deep down I prefer _scientist_.

These thoughts are mine and mine alone, and should not be accredited to my former or current employers.
