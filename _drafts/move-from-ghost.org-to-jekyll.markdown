# Moving the blog from Ghost.org to Jekyll

My process of moving from Ghost.org to Jekyll, on Github pages (Gitlab-pages?).

## Install Jekyll locally

Link-to-gihub-resources


## Export and convert data from Ghost.org

using [Jekyll Ghost Importer](https://github.com/eloyesp/jekyll_ghost_importer)

### Go through all the posts and verify content

### Pictures / images

## Finding a template / theme

I liked the Casper Theme for Ghsot, so I went with [Jasper](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper) as the template when moving to Jekyll.

## Publish
