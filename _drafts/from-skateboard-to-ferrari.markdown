* Skateboard -> kick bike => OK!
* Kick bike -> push bike => Major refactor / new user interface
* Push bike -> moped => Add engine
* Modpen -> car => new user interface
* ...





* Be willing to either throw away first version or keep it as a "simple app" while building a new and improved version
* Backend might be identical, or just expanded. The analogy is more about user interface than backend or complete systems.
