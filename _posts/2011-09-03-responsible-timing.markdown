A week and a half ago now, I came across a blog post I knew I had to comment on, [The Last IRRESPONSIBLE Moment](http://theitriskmanager.wordpress.com/2011/08/25/the-last-irresponsible-moment/). I’ve never really thought about being irresponsible by leaving tasks to what seems to be the last responsible opportunity. It really is irresponsible to use the last opportunity to do something, what if something interferes?
