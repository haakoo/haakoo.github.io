One of the pages I follow using RSS is [Codebetter](http://codebetter.com/), and today there was a [blog post](http://codebetter.com/drusellers/2011/08/06/thought-questions/) about questions that make you think by Dru Sellers. If could almost be considered a personal [retrospective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective#Software_development). It linked to a [blog post](http://wakeuptiger.blogspot.com/2011/08/questions-worth-asking.html) on the Wake Up Tiger blog, and a web page called [Thought Questions](http://thoughtquestions.com/) where there are lots of questions that will make you think. They got me thinking.

The page is now added to my RSS feed and I’ll give each new question a few minutes of thought. As the Wake Up Tiger blog post say:

> “If life begins at the end of your comfort zone — as indeed it does …”

it’s not a bad idea to ask yourself some hard questions that will get you out of your comfort zone.
