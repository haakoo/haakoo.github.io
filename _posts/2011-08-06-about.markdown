I’m Håkon K. Olafsen a Norwegian that lives in Oslo with my Australian girlfriend and our dog Odin. I work as a scientist at Kjeller and my main areas of (academic / work related) interest are software development and robotics / unmanned vehicles with focus on drones.

These thoughts are mine and mine alone, and should not be accredited to my [employer](https://www.ffi.no).
