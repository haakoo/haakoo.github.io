I've had a problem running [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) on my work computer with Windows 7 since I got the computer last year. Today I finally decided to see if I could fix it.

The fix was easier than I thought. Over at the Knowledge Base for Scrivener I found the post [Fixing "Not Responding" with Compatibility Settings](https://scrivener.tenderapp.com/help/kb/windows-troubleshooting/fixing-not-responding-with-compatibility-settings) which solved my problem.

I'm running Windows 7, but by choosing to run *Scrivener.exe in compatibility mode for Windows 7* it now works.

Easy!
