Yet another interesting find on the interweb: [Personal names around the world](http://lostechies.com/derekgreer/2011/07/19/effective-tests-avoiding-context-obscurity/) over at [W3](http://www.w3.org/). It was a bit of a eye opener to me, even though I do have a name that get me in trouble several times each year. There are more variation to personal names than I thought, and Iâ€™ll try to keep that in mind in the future.
