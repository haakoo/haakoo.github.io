I’ve recently installed Ubuntu on my old MacBook Pro (2006), with Norwegian keyboard layout. I couldn’t write $ | and other much needed characters for a programmer / LaTeX enthusiast. I dug around in the *System Settings* | *Keyboard Layout* | *Options* and found *Key to choose 3rd level*. I ticked off for *Left Alt* and my keyboard behaved as expected again!
