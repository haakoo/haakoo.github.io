When I got my brothers old TV a little while back we were using the remote for the TV-decoder to turn the TV on and off. Since we now longer have a TV-decoder I need to program the AV-receiver remote instead. The Yamaha RX-V465 AV-receiver have buttons to control the TV at the bottom, but no information about how to program them in the manual. After a bit of googling I found the answer on [avsforum.com](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1152126/yamaha-rx-v465-remote-question).

1. Press theÂ CODE SET
2. Then choose **[A]** or **[b]** from the *Input selection keys*
3. Enter the code for your TV

If everything worked out the *Transmit* light should blink twice.
