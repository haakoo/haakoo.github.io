As I continued looking into which system to use for comments I came across a [blog post](http://john.do/discourse-comments/) by John Saddington about using Discourse for comments. What I found most interesting though, was this comment about Disqus.

> Things are changing though and Disqus is moving to capitalize on commenters and even going as far as inserting advertisements in the comment stream layer that look like legitimate comments from real users.

If this is true, I will not be using Disqus.
