	     <p>I read an blog post over at The IT Risk Manager blog titled <a href="http://theitriskmanager.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/id-rather-be-wrong-than-be-right/">I’d rather be wrong than be right</a> tonight. The main idea is that you will not learn (much) from a discussion if you are right. But if you are proven wrong, you have learned something new.</p>

<p>I think I could learn something from it. I always try to highlight all angles when I’m in a discussion, and I try to understand and tolerate other views than my own. It might be that I’m a bit to close to “Strong opinion, strongly held”, so I’m planing on keeping this blog post in the back of my mind in the future.</p>
