	     <p>One of the pages I follow using RSS is <a href="http://codebetter.com/">Codebetter</a>, and today there was a <a href="http://codebetter.com/drusellers/2011/08/06/thought-questions/">blog post</a> about questions that make you think by Dru Sellers. If could almost be considered a personal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrospective#Software_development">retrospective</a>. It linked to a <a href="http://wakeuptiger.blogspot.com/2011/08/questions-worth-asking.html">blog post</a> on the Wake Up Tiger blog, and a web page called <a href="http://thoughtquestions.com/">Thought Questions</a> where there are lots of questions that will make you think. They got me thinking.</p>

<p>The page is now added to my RSS feed and I’ll give each new question a few minutes of thought. As the Wake Up Tiger blog post say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If life begins at the end of your comfort zone — as indeed it does …”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it’s not a bad idea to ask yourself some hard questions that will get you out of your comfort zone.</p>
