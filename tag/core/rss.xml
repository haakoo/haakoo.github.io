	     <p>I got stuck trying to figure out where the Visual Studio plugin <em>Visual Studio WCF Connected Service</em> had gone today. It turns out it’s no longer a plugin, but part of Visual Studio since version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes-v15.5#WCFTools">15.5</a>.</p>

<p>I’m converting an old .Net 4.0 project to .Net Core, and it is consuming a WCF-service. Everywhere i looked I found references to a Visual Studio plugin called <em>Visual Studio WCF Connected Service</em>, but it wasn’t on the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Marketplace</a> anymore. After wasting about 30 minutes trying to figure out where to get the plugin I just tried to right click my .Net Core project, and lo and behold there I found <em>Add Connected Service</em> and I could add my WCF-reference.</p>

<p>If only Microsoft could have left the plugin on the Marketplace and told us it was now part of Visual Studio…</p>
