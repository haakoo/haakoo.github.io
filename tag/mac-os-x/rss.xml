	     <p>A friend showed me a problem she had with one of the pictures on her webpage, http://lenefredriksen.com/. In Safari, Chrome and Vivaldi on macOS Sierra and Chrome and Vivaldi on Windows 7, all the pictures had the correct orientation. As in the following screen capture of Safari on macOS below.</p>

<p>In Safari on iOS, one of the pictures on the front page was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, as seen in the screen capture from my iPad below. I checked the source in both macOS and on my phone, but it was the same on both platforms and it looked fine.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/03/iPad.PNG" alt="Screen capture of lenefredriksen.com in Safari on iOS" /></p>

<p>My next step was to download the picture that was rotated and one of the other pictures to compare them. When opening both pictures in QuickLook on my Mac, one was rotated and one was not. This sort of made sense, since that’s how they appeared on the webpage in iOS.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/03/MacOS-Sierra-QuickLook.png" alt="Screen capture of the rotated image in QuickLook on macOS Sierra" /></p>

<p>What didn’t make sense was why both were the right way up on almost all platforms and browsers. Looking at the EXIF data I found that the orientation was set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 (Normal)</code> for the one that was right way up, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6 (Rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise)</code> for the picture that looked rotated.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/03/Orientations.png" alt="Showing the EXIF information for the two images in Previews Inspector" /></p>

<p><strong>It turns out that the problem is that QuickLook and Preview on macOS, and Safari on iOS don’t rotate the picture according to the EXIF data.</strong></p>

<p>The solution was simple: open the rotated picture in Preview and rotate it so it’s correct, and then save it. I assume the same can be done using Windows Photo Viewer if you’re using Windows. If it looks the right way up when you open it, try rotating back and forth and save the changes.</p>

<p>A last hint at the end, you’ll find the Inspector for Preview under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tool</code>and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Show Inspector</code>.</p>

	     <p>I figured it would be nice to have Ghost up and running locally on my machine if I’m to mess around with themes. So today I installed <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, cloned Ghost from <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost">GitHub</a> and got it all working.</p>

<p>I followed the instructions from https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost#developer-install-from-git with a few tweaks. You need to run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> commands using sudo (they will fail and then tell you to rerun as root). I also downloaded and installed Node.js v0.10.40 from <a href="http://blog.nodejs.org/release/">install package</a>. Node.js v0.10.40 has several security fixes and is probably a better choice than v0.10.36 I saw recommended somewhere.</p>

<p>Surprisingly easy to get it all running when I figured out that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> needs root permissions and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grunt</code>does not after a tip from <a href="https://ghost.slack.com/archives/ghost/p1437257215000010">@acburdine in #ghost on Ghost Slack</a>.</p>

<p><em>Edit 2015-07-19:</em> It should be possible to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo</code>, according to <a href="https://ghost.slack.com/archives/ghost/p1437262059000023">@fabian over at Ghost Slack</a>. I’ll see if I can reproduce my troubles from yesterday and figure out what was wrong.</p>
