	     <p>Today I learnt that Travis don’t like <em>tags</em> with spaces in them. It took me over an hour to figure out, but there it is.</p>

<p>If you’re using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> and are building your blog using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a> do not use tags with spaces in them. It doesn’t help putting the tag into <em>apostrophe</em> either.</p>

<p>It worked when I tried locally on my computer (Ubuntu in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">WSL</a> in Windows 10), but it fails silently when run using Travis.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>We had a scare when all the photos from 24th and 25th of December disappeard from our memory card. Lukily I managed to recover them using <a href="https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">PhotoRec</a>.</p>

<p>We have a well used Canon 60D and apparently a dying <a href="https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/memory-cards/sandisk-extreme-pro-uhs-ii-sd#SDSDXPK-032G-ANCIN">SanDisk Extreme PRO 32GB</a> memory card. The card isn’t new, and thinking back I’m not sure this is the first time it’s behaved like this. When we were going to copy the pictures from the memorycard they disappeared. The pictures had been visible on the camera, but when we opened the card in Windows only images about a month old was visible. No photos from the last two days. Something had happend to the memorycard and it had lost part of the File Allocation Table (FAT), so the new image files where <em>“gone”</em>. I have no idea how this happened, but I no longer trust that memory card.</p>

<p>Hoping to recover the files I went looking for a solution online. I spent quite a while trying tools, like <em>SanDisk RescuePRO Deluxe</em> and <em>Lexar Recovery Tool for Windows</em>. Lexar Recovery tool didn’t find anything on the card, not sure if that’s because it is a SanDisk card or not. <em>SanDisk RescuePro</em> did find the missing photos, and gave me a preview of them. If I wanted to restore the photos, I had to buy the software for $60 USD, which felt a bit expensive.</p>

<p>After I knew the photos were on the card I decided to search for another solution that didn’t cost $60. Eventually I came across this <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/330568/how-to-restore-photos-on-sd-card">question over at ask Ubuntu</a>. That led me to the PhotoRec homepage and to the <a href="https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec_Step_By_Step">Step by step guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>I downloaded <a href="https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Download">TestDisk Zip-archive</a> and extracted it to a temp folder. After that it’s fairly straight forward, my choices in paranteses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Activate write lock on your memory card and put it in your computer</li>
  <li>Run ‘photorec_win.exe’ as an administrator</li>
  <li>Select which media to recover from (‘Generic SDXC’)</li>
  <li>Select which partition on the media (‘EOS DIGITAL’)</li>
  <li>Select what filesystem the partition have (‘FAT/NTFS/HFS+/ReiserFS/…’)</li>
  <li>Select what space to be analysed (‘free’ or ‘whole’)</li>
  <li>Select where to store the recovered files (‘C:\Temp\photorec’)</li>
  <li>Choose ‘C’ to confirm location</li>
  <li>Wait</li>
  <li>Quit ‘photorec’</li>
</ol>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I’ve had some fun with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> again… I was checking out a remote branch with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> on the command line and couldn’t pull down updates. Eventually I found out that the problem was case sensitivity in the branch name.</p>

<p>I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout branch-name</code> to get a local copy of the remote branch. When I tried to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code> in that branch I got the following error message:</p>

<pre><code class="language-git">Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/branch-name' from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to search for an fix, but couldn’t find anything that worked. The most common explaination for this error message is that the remote branch is missing.</p>

<p>Eventually I remembered that I had used a capital letter in the branch name when creating it. The actuall branch name was something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">branch-Name</code>, notice the capital <strong><em>N</em></strong>. By having the correct capitalising of the branch name during checkout, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code> works.</p>

<p>This was checking out from Gitlab on a Linux server and to a Windows 10 machine.</p>

	     <p>I got stuck trying to figure out where the Visual Studio plugin <em>Visual Studio WCF Connected Service</em> had gone today. It turns out it’s no longer a plugin, but part of Visual Studio since version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes-v15.5#WCFTools">15.5</a>.</p>

<p>I’m converting an old .Net 4.0 project to .Net Core, and it is consuming a WCF-service. Everywhere i looked I found references to a Visual Studio plugin called <em>Visual Studio WCF Connected Service</em>, but it wasn’t on the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Marketplace</a> anymore. After wasting about 30 minutes trying to figure out where to get the plugin I just tried to right click my .Net Core project, and lo and behold there I found <em>Add Connected Service</em> and I could add my WCF-reference.</p>

<p>If only Microsoft could have left the plugin on the Marketplace and told us it was now part of Visual Studio…</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>We were experiencing a strange bug with a C# library with an embedded binary file. It worked on the developers machine, but not after it was released after being built on a build server.</p>

<p>It turns out that the developer had <em>git checkout end-of-line</em> settings that preserved the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LF</code> character, while the build server converted from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LF</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CR LF</code> upon checkout. This corrupted the binary file that was embedded into the library as an <em>embedded resource</em>. Git didn’t recognise the file type and interpreted it as a (partial) text file.</p>

<h2 id="the-fix">The fix</h2>
<p>I think the preferred way to avoid this is to include a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitattributes</code> file in the root-folder of your repo. In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitattributes</code> file you specify how <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes">git should handle different file types</a>. For us the solution was to add the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>*.pgm binary
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I first found the solution for this in an answer on Stack Overflow, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40821931/930546">How to change line-ending settings</a>.</p>

<h2 id="alternative">Alternative</h2>
<p>It’s also possible to avoid this by changing the git setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">core.autocrlf</code> to either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">input</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>, but this will change the behaviour for all files.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>On Windows I prefer to use Visual Studio’s diff and merge tools. And since I use git I decided to change the default diff and merge tools to Visual Studio 2017 (VS2017).</p>

<h2 id="sourcetree-app">SourceTree App</h2>
<p>I first changed the diff and merge tools in SourceTree App, just to test the settings. I found a nice blog post <a href="http://blog.dudak.me/2016/using-visual-studio-as-diffmerge-tool-in-sourcetree/">Using Visual Studio as diff/merge tool in Git and SourceTree</a> by Michał Dudak explaining how to do this for VS 2015. Since Visual Studio 2017 have a different folder structure I had to look for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vsdiffmerge.exe</code> and with the help of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/DamianReeves/35adf89992f8d871afe6#gistcomment-2024718">comments for a Gist</a> I found the correct location.</p>

<p>In the <em>Diff Options</em> you choose to use <em>Custom tools</em> and use the following settings:</p>

<p><strong>Command:</strong> (same for both diff and merge)</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>C:<span class="se">\P</span>rogram Files <span class="o">(</span>x86<span class="o">)</span><span class="se">\M</span>icrosoft Visual Studio<span class="se">\2</span>017<span class="se">\E</span>nterprise<span class="se">\C</span>ommon7<span class="se">\I</span>DE<span class="se">\C</span>ommonExtensions<span class="se">\M</span>icrosoft<span class="se">\T</span>eamFoundation<span class="se">\T</span>eam Explorer<span class="se">\v</span>sDiffMerge.exe
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Diff arguments:</strong></p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$LOCAL</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$REMOTE</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="s2">"Source"</span> <span class="s2">"Target"</span> //t

	  <guid>//using-nested-ad-groups-to-filter-access-to-gitlab</guid>
	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I struggled while trying to limit access to our internal omnibus Gitlab instance using the LDAP-setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_filter:</code>. We use nested groups in Microsoft AD to handle users and access rights, which works with Gitlab, when you know about the secret sauce.</p>

<h2 id="licensing---you-need-an-enterprise-license">Licensing - you need an enterprise license</h2>
<p>First I tried getting it to work with our Gitlab instance which is running the free community edition. I read through the docs about <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/administration/auth/ldap.html">LDAP</a>, added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_filter:</code> to our settings file and it didn’t work. Users that were added directly to the AD group that was used as a filter got access, but not users in groups in the “main” group, e.g. the group <em>Gitlab-access</em> contains <em>User1</em> and <em>User2</em> and <em>Engineering-group</em>, and <em>Enginerring-group</em> contains <em>User3</em>. Using the following filter:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="ss">user_filter: </span><span class="s1">'(&amp;(objectClass=person)(memberOf=cn=Gitlab-access,dc=domain,dc=com)'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>will only grant access to <em>User1</em> and <em>User2</em>, not <em>User3</em>.</p>

<p>This was’t a trivial discovery, since the Gitlab <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/administration/auth/ldap.html#using-an-ldap-filter-to-limit-access-to-your-gitlab-server">CE documentation</a> seems to indicate that nested AD groups work. It’s only once you see that the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auth/ldap-ee.html#supported-ldap-group-types-attributes">LDAP Additions to Gitlab EE documentation</a> also mention nested AD groups that you realise this might be an EE feature.</p>

<p>I went along and asked for an EE trial license to see if I could get it to work.</p>

<p><em><strong>Edit 2017-07-18:</strong> It turns out that it is possible to use nested AD groups with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_filter:</code> in Gitlab CE. After I contacted Gitlab about the confusion the documentation has been <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/12871">updated</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="special-ad-ldap-query-rules">Special AD LDAP query rules</h2>
<p>The second hurdle was to realise that the <em>plain</em> LDAP query I show higher up wont work because of Microsoft AD. You need to add a special rule object identifier (OID) to get a <em>recursive</em> version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memberOf</code> called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN</code>. More information over at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746475(v=vs.85).aspx">MDSN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This rule is limited to filters that apply to the DN. This is a special “extended” match operator that walks the chain of ancestry in objects all the way to the root until it finds a match.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The resources that helped me understand this were mainly the Stackoverflow questions <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6195812/ldap-nested-group-membership">ldap nested group membership</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9945518/can-ldap-matching-rule-in-chain-return-subtree-search-results-with-attributes">Can LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN return ‘subtree search results’ with attributes (specifically “memberOf”)?</a>. I also found some information over at Atlassians help page <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/crowdkb/active-directory-user-filter-does-not-search-nested-groups-715130424.html">Active Directory user filter does not search nested groups</a></p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user_filter:</code> setting that finally worked was the following:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="ss">user_filter: </span><span class="s1">'(&amp;(objectClass=person)(memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=cn=Gitlab-access,dc=domain,dc=com)'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I recently discovered that it’s impossible to install Windows 7 from a Kingston USB stick. It turns out this is a known problem with <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/asiasupp/2012/03/06/error-we-couldnt-create-a-new-partition-or-locate-an-existing-one-for-more-information-see-the-setup-log-files-when-you-try-to-install-windows-8-cp/">Kingston</a> <a href="https://superuser.com/a/789435/117037">DataTravel</a> sticks. I had this problem while installing Windows 7 Pro on an old Panasonic Toughbook CF-31.</p>

<p>It’s not obvious that you can’t install from these USB sticks, since you can boot into the Windows 7 installer. Everything works up until you’re partitioning your harddrive. There, you’ll get an error message saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Setup was unable to create a new system partition or locate an existing system partition. For more information, see the Setup log files.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="solution">Solution?</h2>
<p>Use a different USB stick. I had a SanDisk stick that worked as expected.</p>

	     <p>A friend showed me a problem she had with one of the pictures on her webpage, http://lenefredriksen.com/. In Safari, Chrome and Vivaldi on macOS Sierra and Chrome and Vivaldi on Windows 7, all the pictures had the correct orientation. As in the following screen capture of Safari on macOS below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/03/Safari.png" alt="Screen capture of lenefredriksen.com in Safari on macOS Sierra" /></p>

<p>In Safari on iOS, one of the pictures on the front page was rotated 90 degrees clockwise, as seen in the screen capture from my iPad below. I checked the source in both macOS and on my phone, but it was the same on both platforms and it looked fine.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2017/03/iPad.PNG" alt="Screen capture of lenefredriksen.com in Safari on iOS" /></p>

<p>My next step was to download the picture that was rotated and one of the other pictures to compare them. When opening both pictures in QuickLook on my Mac, one was rotated and one was not. This sort of made sense, since that’s how they appeared on the webpage in iOS.</p>

<p>What didn’t make sense was why both were the right way up on almost all platforms and browsers. Looking at the EXIF data I found that the orientation was set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 (Normal)</code> for the one that was right way up, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6 (Rotated 90 degrees counter clockwise)</code> for the picture that looked rotated.</p>

<p><strong>It turns out that the problem is that QuickLook and Preview on macOS, and Safari on iOS don’t rotate the picture according to the EXIF data.</strong></p>

<p>The solution was simple: open the rotated picture in Preview and rotate it so it’s correct, and then save it. I assume the same can be done using Windows Photo Viewer if you’re using Windows. If it looks the right way up when you open it, try rotating back and forth and save the changes.</p>

<p>A last hint at the end, you’ll find the Inspector for Preview under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tool</code>and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Show Inspector</code>.</p>
