	     <p>Since I decided to start keeping a blog / diary again, I went to wordpress.com and intended to reactivate my blog. Several years ago I created a blog at wordpress.com to test it out, but I decided not to keep it. I deleted the blog, and thought I could reactivate it when I decided to start blogging again.</p>

<p>What I didn’t realise back then, is that any blog name (blogname.wordpress.com) that are created and then deleted will not be released / become available again. Not even for the person that created and deleted it in the first place.</p>

<p>There are several very good reasons why this is the policy of wordpress.com and you can read more about that in the <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/recycling-blog-names/">support pages</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this means I had to find a new name for my blog, and I decided to just make it personal and use my name.</p>

<p>So here it is, my blog, where I intend to write about what I find interesting, when I come across it…</p>
