	     <p>After reading more about using Discourse for comments I’ve realised that it’s not a good fit for me. There is a solution for Discourse where you can get X number of the best replies shown under a blog post or article. But you will not have a “leave a comment” area under the blog post, the reader will have to go to the Discourse forum, sign in and then leave a comment.</p>

<p>I can see that this might be a good idea for larger sites with lots of comments and where you’re trying to build a community. It looks good over at <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/">Codinghorror’s blog</a>, but I think it’s the wrong solution for me, for now. And you can’t leave a guest comment when using Discourse.</p>

<p>Jeff Atwood’s (@codinghorror) answer to the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have any plans to enable in-post and anonymous commenting via this plugin? - <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-and-wordpress-integration/531/62">@erlend_sh</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>makes it very clear that they do not intend to support guest comments in the future either:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, none whatsoever. - <a href="(https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-and-wordpress-integration/531/62)">@codinghorror</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Discourse will not be my choice now.</p>

	     <p>After playing with <a href="http://www.ghost.org">Ghost</a> for a couple of days I still haven’t figured out what to do with comments. Ideally I want something like Wordpress’ built in system, where you can post “anonymously” without registering and still get updates by email.</p>

<p>I have read a few blog posts recently that made me look at using Twitter for comments. That might work out for me, since I use Twitter so much, but not if I’m to use Ghost for other people’s blogs.</p>

<p>After I realised that <a href="https://disqus.com/websites/">Disqus</a> allows commenting without signing up I thought that might be a good fit. But they do not support notifications without signing up, and I do not want my readers to have to sign up to Disqus, so it’s not a perfect fit for me.</p>

<p>I looked at <a href="https://muut.com/">Muut</a> but it seems to be overkill for what I want (a simple comment system). The same goes for <a href="http://web.livefyre.com/">Livefyre</a>.</p>

<p>Since I want readers to post without signing up Facebook and Google+ comments are out of the question. It doesn’t help that I rarely use the services myself.</p>

<p>Then we have <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, but last time I looked it looked too focused on creating a “forum”, and not a comments system. I’ll have a new look at Discourse tomorrow.</p>
