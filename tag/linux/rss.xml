	     <p>I’ve had some fun with <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> again… I was checking out a remote branch with <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> on the command line and couldn’t pull down updates. Eventually I found out that the problem was case sensitivity in the branch name.</p>

<p>I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">git checkout branch-name</code> to get a local copy of the remote branch. When I tried to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git pull</code> in that branch I got the following error message:</p>

<pre><code class="language-git">Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/branch-name' from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
</code></pre>

<p>I tried to search for an fix, but couldn’t find anything that worked. The most common explaination for this error message is that the remote branch is missing.</p>

<p>Eventually I remembered that I had used a capital letter in the branch name when creating it. The actuall branch name was something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">branch-Name</code>, notice the capital <strong><em>N</em></strong>. By having the correct capitalising of the branch name during checkout, <code class="highlighter-rouge">git pull</code> works.</p>

<p>This was checking out from Gitlab on a Linux server and to a Windows 10 machine.</p>
